# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file over time. It is useful because because it allows you to go back to earlier versions of your project and see what changes you have made. This is especially helpful when working collaboratively. By using version control, multiple people can keep track of each other's changes to a project. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master code. Branching is useful because you can work on different versions of the master code. This is especially helpful when working collaboratively. Other people can work on different versions of the main code without messing up the main line. You can merge whichever branches you want back into the master branch.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is the process of recording changes into the repository. A good commit message should make it easy for other programmers to read and understand the changes that were made. These messages should be spelled out correctly, use good grammar, have relevant content, and be succinct. 
* What is a merge conflict?
There are a few types of merge conflicts. The most commmon is called an edit collision. An edit collision occurs when two branches have changed the same part of the same file and then are merged together. Git has trouble understanding which changes should be made. Another merge conflict error that occurs is a removed file conflict; this happens when one person edits a file, and another person deletes that file in their branch. This causes confusion in Git.
